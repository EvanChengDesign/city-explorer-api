# City Explorer API

**Author**: Evan Cheng  
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview

The objective of this lab assignment is to develop a foundation for a comprehensive City Explorer application by constructing a custom API server. This server will act as a central hub, interfacing with various third-party APIs to aggregate and supply pertinent data about different urban locales to the City Explorer front-end.

Custom API Server Development: The primary task is to develop an API server from scratch. This server will manage requests from the City Explorer front-end, process these requests by interacting with multiple third-party APIs, and then compile the responses to be sent back to the user interface.

Integration with Third-Party APIs: A key feature of this project is the integration with various third-party APIs. These APIs will provide a range of data, specifically, weather forecasts.

Weather API Introduction: A significant addition to this project is the integration of a Weather API. This feature will allow users to view current weather conditions, forecasts, and other meteorological data for their city of interest directly within the City Explorer application. By incorporating real-time weather information, the application aims to deliver a more dynamic and useful service to its users, catering to travelers, researchers, and locals alike.
